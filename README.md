# Description
Looking for movie suggestions? This is a website that displays my Popcorn TV movie recommendation site portfolio. The public API of The Movie Database (TMDB) was used to obtain the movie catalogue. The site organizes all of the most recent movies by popularity. You can also look up any movie and get its rating.
The UI design of the site was borrowed from [UI Design Daily](https://uidesigndaily.com/posts/photoshop-movie-app-mobile-day-193) which is a free, Open-source UI design resource that is updated daily.
# Requirements
Either a computer, phone, tablet or an Ipad and access to the Internet.

# Technology Used
HTML - which was used to build the structure of the pages.

CSS - which was used to style the pages.

Javascript - which was used to add interactivity to the site as well as manipulate the DOM

TMDB - a public API which offers an editable database for movies and TV shows.
